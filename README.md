# Fatal Fire — Standalone Desktop Apps

This is the repository for standalone desktop releases of Fatal Fire, an interactive musical audioplay about beliefs, creativity, and meaning. Releases are available for Mac and Windows and update automatically when a new version is released. 
<br><br>
To download, click the [Releases](https://github.com/vjmanzo/Fatal-Fire/releases) link and select the `Fatal-Fire-x.x-arm64.dmg` for Mac or `Fatal.Fire-x.x-Setup.exe` for Windows. 

<br><br>
Additionally, a fully-offline, non-updatable archival version of the app is available for [Mac](https://vjmanzo.com/ff/releases/Fatal-Fire-Mac.dmg) and [Windows](https://vjmanzo.com/ff/releases/Fatal-Fire-Win.zip); though the above version is highly recommended in lieu of this one. <br><br>
